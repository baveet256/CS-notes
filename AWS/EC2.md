>Security Groups:  
	
	Can be attached to multiple instances, Locked down to a region/ VPC combination
	
	Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it.
	
	It's good to maintain one seperate security group for SSH access
	
	if your application is not accessible, then it's a security group issue
  

	ports:
	
	SSH - port 22
	
	FTP - 21 file transfer protocol
	
	SFTP - 22 secure file transfer protocol
	
	HTTP - 80, Access unsecured websites
	
	HTTPS - 443 access secured websites
	
	RDP (remote desktop protocol) - 3389 log into a windows instance



>The EC2 instance getsÂ **temporary credentials automatically**Â via theÂ **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**.
>
	Any app inside the EC2 that uses the AWS SDK/CLI can automatically pick up those credentials and talk to S3 without you needing to configure access keys.
	
	Example:	
	1. You attach an IAM role withÂ `AmazonS3FullAccess`Â to your EC2.
	    
	2. You SSH into the EC2.
	    
	3. Run:
	    
	    1. aws s3 ls
	    
	4. It works, even though you never didÂ `aws configure`Â â€” because the role is providing temporary credentials.
	    
	
	IAM roles areÂ **permission sets for AWS services**Â that you can attach to resources like EC2. Once attached, anyone using that resource can act with those permissions.

#TYPES

>On demand (For short termÂ  and un-interrupted workloads) - billing per second, all other - billing per hour, highest cost and no upfront payment,Â  no long term .

>Ec2Â  ReservedÂ  (For steady state usage applications) -Â  discounted than on demand, reserve a specific instance attribute if more time reserved then discount increases more. Payment option - No upfront - less discount, All upfront - Max discount

>Convertible Reserved Instance - can change EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy

>EC2 Savings plan - locked to specific instance family and region (series and a region)

>EC2 Spot Instances (For workloads, resilient to failure, not for critical jobs) - can lose if user's max price is less than current spot price, the most cost efficient workloads

>EC2 dedicated Hosts (when compliance requirement or complicated licensing model , bring your own license (BYOL), most expensive)-

>EC2Â  dedicated Instances - Reserve On demand instances in a specific AZ for any duration


>>EC2 Spot Instances:

define max spot price, to get instance, if current spot price. < max spot price, get the instance

if current spot price > max spot price:

then you can stop or terminate instance with a 2 minutes grace period

  
SPOT Requests:

#### **One-time (default)**

- Request is fulfilled once.
    
- If instance is launched and later terminated (either by you or AWS), the request isÂ **closed**.
    
- It wonâ€™t try again automatically.
    

Use this if you only needÂ **cheap compute once**Â and donâ€™t want auto-relaunch.

#### 2.Â **Persistent**

- RequestÂ **remains open**Â until you manually cancel it.
    
- If the instance is terminated by AWS (capacity reclaimed), the request will try toÂ **launch a replacement instance**Â when capacity becomes available again.
    
- This is useful for workloads that can tolerate interruptions but shouldÂ **resume automatically**Â when capacity is back.


>>>>SPOT Workflow

- You submit aÂ **Spot Request**.
    
    - Specify instance type, AMI, VPC/subnet, max price (optional), and whether itâ€™sÂ **one-time**Â orÂ **persistent**.
        
- AWS checks if thereâ€™s available spare capacity at or below your price.
    
    - If yes â†’ AWS launches the instance.
        
    - If no â†’ your request stays pending until capacity is available.
        
- If AWS needs the capacity back â†’ they terminate your instance, but your request type (one-time/persistent) decides what happens next.
    

State Meaning :Â Â **Open -**Â Waiting for capacity (not fulfilled yet).Â **Active -**Â Running instances are attached to the request.Â **Disabled -**Â Temporarily paused (no new launches).Â **Closed -**Â Fulfilled once and finished (canâ€™t reopen).Â **Cancelled -**Â Request terminated by you, no new launches.

Canceling a Spot request doesnt terminate instances, and spot request can only be cancelled when they are open , active or disabled



>>- AÂ **Spot Fleet**Â is a collection ofÂ **Spot Instances (and optionally On-Demand instances)**Â managed as a single unit.
    
- AWS automatically launches and maintains the fleet to meetÂ **your target capacity**.
    

#### ðŸ›  Key Features

1. **Target Capacity**
    
    - Specify how many total vCPUs or instances you want.
        
    - AWS launches multiple instance types across Availability Zones to reach that target.
        
2. **Allocation Strategies**
    
    - **LowestPrice:**Â Launches instances in the cheapest AZs/instance types.
        
    - **Diversified:**Â Spreads instances across multiple AZs to reduce risk of interruption.
        
    - **CapacityOptimized:**Â Picks AZs least likely to be interrupted.
        
    - priceCapacityOptimised: pools with the highest capacity and then select pool with the lowest price
        
3. **Mix of Spot + On-Demand**
    
    - You can mix Spot + On-Demand to balanceÂ **cost vs reliability**.


#### SPOTÂ FLEETÂ WORKFLOW

1. Define fleet â†’ specify target capacity, instance types, AZs, allocation strategy.
    
2. AWS launches instances to match your capacity.
    
3. Spot interruptions â†’ fleet automatically replaces instances according to your strategy.
    
4. You canÂ **update or scale**Â the fleet anytime.
    

âœ…Â **In short:**

- Spot Fleet =Â **managed group of Spot (and optionally On-Demand) instances**.
    
- Automatically handlesÂ **launch, termination, replacement, and scaling**Â to maintain target capacity.


>**EC2 User Data** (a bootstrap script) to install software and update OS packages during the **first boot** of the instance.



>EC2 Placement group, specify strategies, like : Clusters - clusters instances into a low latency group in a single AZ (Low latency high throughput). Spread - spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ) - Critical Applications.

Partition Placement Group (your question)

- **Idea:**Â AWS divides the hardware intoÂ **partitions**Â (like logical racks). Each partition has its own set of racks, power, and networking. EachÂ **partition**Â is isolated from failure
    
- When you launch EC2 instances in aÂ **partition placement group**, AWS makes sure thatÂ **instances in different partitions donâ€™t share the same underlying hardware**.
    
    Use case:
    
- Best forÂ **big data workloads (Hadoop, HDFS, Cassandra, Kafka, etc.)**
    
- You can have up toÂ **7 partitions per AZ**.
