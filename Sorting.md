## Selection Sort

	Select i and j starts from i+1, pick the minimum element while completing the j loop, and then swap it with i, then again continue like this

	"Select the minimum element, then swap with i"


## Bubble Sort

	Heaviest Element pulled towards the end.

	outer loop starts from the end, inner j loop from 0 to i-1

## Insertion sort

	we maintain a sorted left array as we move forward, so for i we gonna start from there and go till index 0 (j), make sure that this subarray array is sorted.
continue until we reach the end, that means from end to index 0, the whole array becomes sorted.

## Bucket Sort

Consider the frequency as index. 

make a map that stores elements and its frequencies

then a vector/ list of list that stores the elements, based on frequency as index and list as the elements that have frequency == that array index

ABSOLUTE CINEMA!
