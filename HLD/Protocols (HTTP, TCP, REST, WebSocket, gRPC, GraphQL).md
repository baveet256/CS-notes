>1. What is HTTP, and how does it work?
>    ‚óè Definition: ‚óã HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of communication on the web. ‚óã It enables the transfer of resources such as web pages, images, and API responses. 
>    ‚óè How It Works: ‚óã A client (browser, mobile app, API client) sends an HTTP request to a web server. ‚óã The server processes the request and returns an HTTP response containing data or an error message. ‚óã The client receives the response and renders the requested resource (e.g., a webpage).
>     ‚óè Example: ‚óã When you type https://www.example.com in a browser: ‚ñ† The browser sends a GET request to the web server. ‚ñ† The server responds with the HTML of the webpage. ‚ñ† The browser displays the webpage to the user.

>Why is HTTP considered a stateless protocol? 
>‚óè Statelessness in HTTP: ‚óã HTTP does not retain memory of previous requests between the client and server. ‚óã Each request is treated as independent, meaning the server does not store session information. 
>‚óè Challenges Due to Statelessness: ‚óã Maintaining user sessions (e.g., staying logged in). ‚óã Every request must include necessary information (e.g., authentication tokens). 
>‚óè Solutions to Maintain State: ‚óã Cookies ‚Äì Stored in the browser and sent with requests. ‚óã Sessions ‚Äì Server-side storage of user data. ‚óã Tokens (JWT, OAuth) ‚Äì Used for authentication and API security

>2. What are HTTP methods? 
>   When would you use PUT vs. PATCH? 
>   ‚óè Common HTTP Methods & Use Cases: ‚óã GET ‚Äì Retrieve a resource. ‚óã POST ‚Äì Create a new resource. ‚óã PUT ‚Äì Update an entire resource. ‚óã PATCH ‚Äì Partially update a resource. ‚óã DELETE ‚Äì Remove a resource. 
>   ‚óè PUT vs. PATCH: Method Use Case Example PUT Replaces an entire resource Updating a user profile (name, email, password, etc.) PATCH Updates part of a resource, Changing only the email of a user without modifying the name



> How does TCP ensure reliability? 
   TCP guarantees reliable communication using the following mechanisms: 
   ‚óè Three-Way Handshake: Establishes a connection before data transmission. 
   ‚óè Acknowledgments (ACKs): Confirms receipt of packets. 
   ‚óè Retransmission of Lost Packets: If a packet is lost, TCP resends it. 
   ‚óè Error Checking: Uses checksums to detect corrupted packets. 
   ‚óè Ordered Data Delivery: Reassembles packets in the correct order before passing them to the application.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Questions

### **1. What is REST, and how does it differ from SOAP?**

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an **architectural style** that defines a set of constraints for designing web services. It primarily uses **standard HTTP methods** and focuses on **resources** rather than operations.

**Differences between REST and SOAP:**

|Aspect|REST|SOAP|
|---|---|---|
|Protocol|Architectural style|Strict protocol|
|Data Format|Typically JSON|XML|
|Performance|Lightweight and faster|Slower due to XML + WS-Security|
|Flexibility|Supports JSON, XML, HTML, etc.|XML only|
|Statefulness|Stateless|Can be stateful|

---

### **2. Six Constraints of REST Architecture**

1. **Client-Server Architecture** ‚Äì Separation of concerns for scalability.
    
2. **Statelessness** ‚Äì Each request contains all necessary info; no session state on server.
    
3. **Cacheability** ‚Äì Responses can be cached to improve performance.
    
4. **Layered System** ‚Äì System can be layered (e.g., security, load balancer) without client impact.
    
5. **Uniform Interface** ‚Äì Standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    
6. **Code on Demand (Optional)** ‚Äì Server can send executable code (e.g., JavaScript) to the client.
    

---

### **3. REST API vs. RESTful API**

- **REST API** ‚Üí Follows _some_ REST principles.
    
- **RESTful API** ‚Üí Fully compliant with _all six_ REST constraints.
    

---

### **4. What is a Resource in REST?**

- A **resource** is any object/entity accessible via the API (e.g., users, products).
    
- Represented by **URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)**.
    

**Examples:**

```
/users/{id}
/products/{id}
```

---

### **5. What are Endpoints in REST APIs?**

An **endpoint** is a specific URL where a client interacts with a resource.

# ‚ö° Real-Time Communication (RTC) ‚Äî Interview Questions & Answers

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Real-Time Communication, and Why is it Important?

### **Answer:**

**Real-time communication (RTC)** refers to _instantaneous data exchange_ between systems with minimal latency.  
Unlike traditional request-response models, RTC ensures **continuous, live updates** without requiring manual refreshes.

### **Why it‚Äôs Important**

- ‚ö° **Low Latency:** Enables immediate data transmission.
    
- üåê **Seamless UX:** No need for page refreshes or user-triggered updates.
    
- üß© **Critical Applications:** Used in chat apps, live streaming, stock markets, online games, and IoT.
    

### **Examples**

- WhatsApp messaging
    
- Live stock tickers (NASDAQ, NYSE)
    
- Multiplayer gaming (Fortnite, Call of Duty)
    
- Live sports score updates
    

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Do WebSockets Work, and How Do They Differ from Traditional HTTP?

### **Answer:**

**WebSockets** provide a **persistent, full-duplex connection** over a single TCP connection, allowing both the client and server to send data at any time.

### **How WebSockets Work**

1. Client sends an **HTTP Upgrade** request to initiate WebSocket communication.
    
2. Server responds with **`101 Switching Protocols`** if supported.
    
3. Persistent connection is established ‚Äî no repeated requests required.
    
4. Both client and server can **send messages asynchronously**.
    

### **Differences from Traditional HTTP**

|Feature|WebSockets|Traditional HTTP|
|---|---|---|
|**Connection**|Persistent, full-duplex|Closed after each request-response|
|**Latency**|Low|Higher (new request each time)|
|**Communication**|Bi-directional|Client ‚Üí Server only|
|**Overhead**|Minimal (single TCP connection)|High (repeated headers)|

**Example:**

- WebSockets ‚Üí Live chat apps (Slack, Discord)
    
- HTTP ‚Üí Static blogs or pages
    

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the WebSocket Handshake Process

### **Answer:**

The **WebSocket handshake** upgrades a standard HTTP connection into a WebSocket connection.

### **Steps**

**Client request:**

```
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9YZrd6w==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

**Server response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
```

After this handshake, the connection remains open for **real-time message exchange**.

### **Why the WebSocket Key?**

- Prevents confusion with normal HTTP requests.
    
- Server hashes the client‚Äôs `Sec-WebSocket-Key` and returns `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`.
    

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is Long Polling, and How Does It Work?

### **Answer:**

**Long polling** keeps an HTTP request open until the server has new data to send.

### **How It Works**

1. Client sends an HTTP request.
    
2. Server holds the request open until new data is ready.
    
3. Server responds once data is available.
    
4. Client immediately re-sends another request.
    

**Example:** Gmail uses long polling to check for new emails.

### **Comparison with WebSockets**

|Feature|WebSockets|Long Polling|
|---|---|---|
|**Connection**|Persistent|Multiple HTTP requests|
|**Efficiency**|Low overhead|High overhead|
|**Latency**|Lower|Higher|
|**Best For**|High-frequency updates|Less frequent updates|

---

## üîπ INTERMEDIATE QUESTIONS

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages of WebSockets Over Long Polling

‚úÖ **Persistent connection:** No repeated HTTP requests.  
‚úÖ **Low latency:** Real-time message push.  
‚úÖ **Efficient:** Minimal network overhead.  
‚úÖ **Bidirectional:** Both client and server can send messages anytime.

**Use Cases:**

- Live chat (Slack, WhatsApp)
    
- Real-time stock updates (NASDAQ)
    
- Multiplayer games (Fortnite)
    

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ When to Prefer Long Polling Over WebSockets

### **Answer:**

Use **Long Polling** when:

- WebSockets not supported (older browsers, restricted firewalls).
    
- Real-time needs are minimal.
    
- Easier integration with REST APIs.
    
- Simple backend setup (no WebSocket server).
    

**Use Cases:**

- Social feed updates (Facebook, Twitter)
    
- Email alerts (Gmail new mail)
    

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ How Does WebSockets Handle Connection Failures or Network Interruptions?

### **Answer:**

1. **Automatic reconnection:** Clients retry connections automatically.
    
2. **Heartbeat mechanism:** Uses _ping/pong_ messages to detect failures.
    
3. **Backoff strategies:** Gradually increase retry intervals to avoid overload.
    

**Example:**  
Slack reconnects seamlessly when switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Can You Use WebSockets with Load Balancers? How?

### **Answer:**

Yes ‚Äî WebSockets work with load balancers but require **sticky sessions** or **connection-aware routing**.

### **Techniques**

‚úÖ **Sticky Sessions:** Keep a client on the same backend node.  
‚úÖ **Reverse Proxy:** NGINX / HAProxy can proxy WebSocket `Upgrade` headers.  
‚úÖ **WebSocket Gateways:** Services like **AWS API Gateway** manage connections at scale.

**Example:**  
Slack uses AWS ELB with sticky sessions for WebSocket connections.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges of Scaling WebSockets in Distributed Systems

### **Challenges**

‚ö† Maintaining state across multiple servers.  
‚ö† Handling millions of concurrent connections.  
‚ö† Load balancing with persistent sessions.  
‚ö† Detecting and recovering from connection failures.

### **Solutions**

- Use **Redis Pub/Sub** or **Kafka** for broadcasting messages across nodes.
    
- Implement **sticky sessions** at the load balancer.
    
- Use **WebSocket gateways** (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Socket.IO clusters).
    

---

**‚úÖ Summary**

- Real-time communication enables live, low-latency updates.
    
- WebSockets provide persistent, bi-directional connections.
    
- Long polling is simpler but less efficient.
    
- Scaling WebSockets requires careful design (Redis/Kafka, sticky sessions, load balancing).
