NodeJS Module Wrapper
```javascript
(function wrapper (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {  
       
    
 });
```

Every source code in nodejs, is stored in NodeJS wrapper and that runs when executed like wrapper();


require checks / starts searching

First, if there is 3rd party
Second, built in module,
Third, Error Throw now
